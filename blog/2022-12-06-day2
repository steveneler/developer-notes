Today, we learned a lot about a few topics:
    - Data Types
        -Learned about the difference between Value Types and Reference Types
            -Stack vs. Heap
        -Finally found out the usefulness of the "var" type instead of specifying data types every time
    - Classes and Encapsulation
        - Learned several helpful shortcuts on how to quickly set up different classes with methods used elsewhere to create abstraction
        - Got useful insight into Test-Driven Development and how to use a "meaningfully" failing test as a good jumping off point
